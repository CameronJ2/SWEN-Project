## Description 
	Summit Sprint is a competitive 2d platformer racing game where the goal is to safely reach the top of the map or outpace your opponent in a best of three format. There are three unique levels that get more difficult with each round. A player wins a round in one of three ways: 
        Your opponent hits a lava hazard.
        You touch the green zone at the top of the map before the opponent.
        You outpace the opponent enough that the screen pans above their character.
